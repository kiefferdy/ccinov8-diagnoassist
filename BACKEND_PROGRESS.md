- **Episodes**: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE `/api/v1/episodes/`
- **Encounters**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE `/api/v1/encounters/`
- **Health Check**: GET `/health`
- **API Documentation**: Available at `/docs` and `/redoc`

### Data Models Completed

## Key Decisions & Notes

### Technology Stack Confirmed
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: MongoDB (primary) + HAPI FHIR R4 (compliance)
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Authentication**: JWT-based
- **Real-time**: WebSockets
- **Testing**: Pytest

### Architecture Patterns
- Repository-Service-Route layered architecture
- Hybrid data storage (MongoDB + FHIR)
- Pydantic schemas for validation
- Async/await patterns throughout

## Next Steps - Phase 2: Authentication & Security

### Upcoming Tasks (Phase 2)
1. **JWT Authentication Setup**
   - Install and configure JWT libraries
   - Create JWT utility functions  
   - Implement token generation and validation

2. **User Management**
   - User model with password hashing
   - Authentication endpoints (login, logout, refresh)
   - Password security with bcrypt

3. **Authorization Middleware**
   - JWT token validation middleware
   - Role-based access control
   - Protected endpoint decorators

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - CORS configuration (already basic setup)
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Input sanitization and validation

### Ready for Phase 2
Phase 1 is complete and all deliverables have been achieved. The foundation is solid and ready for implementing authentication and security features in Phase 2.
