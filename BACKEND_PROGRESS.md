## Key Decisions & Notes

### Technology Stack Confirmed
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: MongoDB (primary) + HAPI FHIR R4 (compliance)
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Authentication**: JWT-based
- **Real-time**: WebSockets
- **Testing**: Pytest

### Architecture Patterns
- Repository-Service-Route layered architecture
- Hybrid data storage (MongoDB + FHIR)
- Pydantic schemas for validation
- Async/await patterns throughout

- [x] Password security with bcrypt

#### Task 2.3: Implement authorization middleware ✅
- [x] JWT token validation middleware
- [x] Role-based access control
- [x] Protected endpoint decorators

### Week 4: Security Features

#### Task 2.4: Enhance security measures ✅

- **Rate Limiting**: 5 login attempts per 5 minutes, 10 auth requests per minute
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Student with specific permissions
- **Protected Endpoints**: All patient, episode, encounter endpoints require authentication
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements and bcrypt hashing
